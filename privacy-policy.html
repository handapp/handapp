      <h2>8. Disclosure of Data</h2>

      <h4>We may disclose personal information that we collect, or you provide:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>(a)</strong>
          Disclosure for Law Enforcement.
          Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(b)</strong>
          Business Transaction.
          If we or our subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be

          <ul>

      <h2>9. Security of Data</h2>

      <p>
        The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or
        method of electronic storage is absolutely, one hundred percent secure. While we endeavor to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>

      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
        privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United
        States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at:

      </p>

      <h4>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>(a)</strong>
          users can visit our site anonymously;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(b)</strong>
          our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the page specified above on
          the home page of our website;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(c)</strong>
          users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>(d)</strong>
          users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <a
            href="mailto:care@handm.app" dusk="contact-us">care@handm.app</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</h4>

      <p>
        We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser
        mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you
        do not want to be tracked.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
      </p>

      <h4>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>

      <p>
        GDPR is the European Union regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
        personal data and on the free movement of such data. See more at:
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. Wellness
        Tech
        aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.
      </p>


      <h4>Data Controller</h4>

      <p>
        If and when Wellness Tech receives your personal information directly from you via the Services, it performs the
        functions of a Data Controller, as defined by the GDPR, and has the ability to determine how personal data is
        collected, for what purposes, and how this data is to be processed. As the data controller, Wellness Tech has
        implemented many technical and operational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data
        processed through the Services.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Processor</h4>

      <p>
        Wellness Tech processes your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and uses industry standard
        safeguards to secure it.
      </p>


      <h4>Consent</h4>

      <p>
        If you are a EU Person, consents concerning your personal information are handled in compliance with the GDPR.
        If
        and when consent requirements under this Privacy Policy conflict with the GDPR, the GDPR will prevail in case
        you
        are a EU Person.
      </p>

      <h4>Legal Basis for Processing</h4>

      <p>
        Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which Wellness Tech obtains
        consent for a particular purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a
        contract to which you are a party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to
        provide a service, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b). The same applies to such processing operations which
        are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning
        Wellness
        Tech Services. If Wellness Tech is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is
        required,
        such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)(c). If the processing of
        personal data may be necessary to protect your vital interests or that of another EU Person, then the processing
        is based on Art. 6(1)(d). Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1)(f) if processing is
        necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Wellness Tech or by a third party, except
        where
        such interests are overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms under the GDPR.
      </p>

      <h4>GDPR Rights:</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>(a) Right of Confirmation</strong><br/>
        You may obtain confirmation of whether or not your personal data is being processed. If you wish to exercise

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(b) Right of Access</strong><br/>

        wish

        below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(c) Right to Rectification</strong><br/>

        processing, you have the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data completed or deleted, by means of
        first appropriately identifying yourself and then providing a supplementary statement. If you wish to exercise
        your right of rectification please contact Wellness Tech using the contact information as provided below.

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(e) Right to Restriction of Processing</strong><br/>
        <strong>As an EU Person, you have the right to restrict processing where one of the following
          applies:</strong><br/>
        <strong>(i)</strong> The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling
        the controller to
        verify the accuracy of the personal data;<br/>
        <strong>(ii)</strong> The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data
        and requests instead
        the restriction of the controllers use of such data;<br/>
        <strong>(iii)</strong> The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but they
        are required by
        the data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims;<br/>
        <strong>(iv)</strong> The data subject has objected to processing pending the verification whether the
        legitimate grounds of the
        controller override those of the data subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(f) Right to Data Portability</strong><br/>
        You may request to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You
        have
        the right to transmit this data to another controller without interference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, you may have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where
        technically
        feasible and where such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(g) Right to Object to Automated Decision Making</strong>
        You may object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal
        effects or similarly significantly affects you, as long as the decision is not (i) necessary for entering into,
        or
        the performance of, a contract between you and Wellness Tech; (ii) authorized by European Union or Member State
        law to which you are subject; or (iii) based on the data subject’s explicit consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(h) Right to Object to Processing</strong><br/>
        You may object to the processing of your personal data using the contact information as provided below, unless
        there are legitimate grounds for the processing within the public interest, or for the establishment, exercise,
        or defense of legal claims.<br/>
        If Wellness Tech processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at
        any
        time to the processing of your personal data for such purposes. This right also applies to profiling to the
        extent
        that the processing is related to such direct marketing purposes. If you object to Wellness Tech processing your
        personal data for direct marketing purposes, then Wellness Tech will no longer process the personal data for
        such
        purposes.
